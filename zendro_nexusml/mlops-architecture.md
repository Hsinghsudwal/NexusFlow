# MLOps Architecture

## System Overview

This MLOps architecture implements a complete ML lifecycle for customer churn prediction:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Extract, transform, and load customer data
2. **Model Training**: Train Pipelines
3. **Model Versioning**: Track experiments and models with MLflow
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing and deployment
5. **Serving Infrastructure**: Deploy models on Kubernetes with monitoring
6. **Local Development**: Docker Compose setup with LocalStack and local databases

## Key Technologies

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Kubeflow**: ML toolkit for Kubernetes (Pipelines, KFServing)
- **MLflow**: Model tracking and registry
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring
- **LocalStack**: Local AWS services simulation
- **PostgreSQL**: Local database
- **FastAPI**: Model serving API
- **Python**: ML model development

## System Components

1. **Development Environment**: Local setup with Docker Compose
2. **Feature Store**: Feature computation and storage
3. **Training Pipeline**: Model training workflows with Kubeflow
4. **Model Registry**: Version control for ML models
5. **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated model deployment
6. **Monitoring System**: Performance and drift monitoring
7. **Retraining Pipeline**: Automated model retraining
