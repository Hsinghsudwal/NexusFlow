MLOps is a great field that bridges machine learning and DevOps to streamline model deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management. Here’s a structured approach to get started:

1. Understand the Basics
Learn Machine Learning fundamentals (if you haven’t already).
Understand DevOps concepts like CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and monitoring.
2. Learn MLOps Principles
Model versioning and reproducibility.
Automated testing and CI/CD pipelines for ML models.
Model monitoring, retraining, and scaling.
3. Tools to Master
Version Control: Git, DVC (Data Version Control)
CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD
Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow
Experiment Tracking: MLflow, Weights & Biases
Model Serving: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, FastAPI
Cloud Platforms: AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure ML
4. Hands-on Projects
Set up an end-to-end ML pipeline (data ingestion → model training → deployment → monitoring).
Deploy a model using FastAPI and Docker.
Create a CI/CD pipeline for ML models.
Implement model monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
5. Advanced Topics
Feature stores (e.g., Feast)
Model drift detection
AutoML and Hyperparameter tuning
