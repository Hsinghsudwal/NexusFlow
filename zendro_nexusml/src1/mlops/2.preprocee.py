To extend the existing MLOps pipeline with Data Preprocessing, we need to implement two main tasks:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and filter out outliers.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features, create new features, and normalize/standardize the data.
These tasks will be added as additional steps after data collection and before data ingestion (uploading to S3).

Let's go ahead and integrate these preprocessing steps into the existing pipeline.

Steps:
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values.
Remove duplicates.
Filter out outliers (e.g., based on IQR or Z-score).
Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features.
Create new features (e.g., time-based features, aggregation).
Normalize or standardize the data.

Here's the extended pipeline including data preprocessing with Prefect for scheduling, retries, logging, and monitoring.

import numpy as np

from prefect.utilities.logging import get_logger
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = get_logger()

# Define a retryable delay function
def retryable_delay():
    logger.info("Retrying in 5 seconds...")
    sleep(5)

# Step 1: Data Collection from API with retries
@task(max_retries=3, retry_delay=retryable_delay)
def collect_data_from_api():
    url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Will raise an HTTPError if the response code is not 200
        data = response.json()

# Step 2: Data Cleaning
@task

    logger.info("Data cleaning completed: Missing values handled, duplicates removed, and outliers filtered.")
    return df_no_outliers

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
@task
def feature_engineering(df):
    # Example feature engineering: create a new column based on existing ones
    df['title_length'] = df['title'].apply(len)  # Example: Feature for length of the title text

    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df['userId_normalized'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['userId']])

# Step 4: Data Ingestion to LocalStack S3
@task

# Step 5: Data Ingestion to AWS S3
@task

Explanation of Enhancements:
Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: We use df.dropna() to drop rows with missing values (this can be customized to use df.fillna() if you prefer to fill missing values).
Removing Duplicates: The task removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame with df.drop_duplicates().
Filtering Outliers: We use Z-score (with a threshold of 3) to filter out rows that contain extreme outliers in numerical columns.
Feature Engineering:

Creating New Features: We create a new feature title_length, which is the length of the title column.
Normalization: We normalize the userId column using StandardScaler from sklearn. This scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Integration into the Prefect Flow:

The tasks clean_data and feature_engineering are executed after data collection.
The preprocessed data (df_featured) is then uploaded to both LocalStack S3 and AWS S3.
Retries, Logging, and Monitoring:

Prefect's Retry Mechanism: We still have retries for the data collection (collect_data_from_api), which will retry up to 3 times with a delay of 5 seconds between attempts.
Logging: We log the cleaning and feature engineering steps to track the progress and output of each task.
Monitoring: Prefect's monitoring UI helps track the flow state and logs for better observability.
Additional Considerations:
Outlier Detection: The Z-score method is used here for outlier detection. You can adjust the threshold or use other methods like IQR (Interquartile Range) based on the data characteristics.

Data Imputation: If dropping rows with missing values is not acceptable, you can modify the clean_data task to use data imputation (e.g., df.fillna(df.mean()) for numerical columns).

Monitoring with Prefect:
Once you run this pipeline, Prefect will automatically monitor the flow execution. You can view the status of each task in the Prefect UI, see retry attempts, and access the detailed logs for each step.

Running the Pipeline:
Run the Prefect Agent (locally):

bash
Copy
prefect agent start -q default
Execute the Flow:

python
Copy
flow.run()
Monitor the Execution:

Use the Prefect UI to track your flow's progress and view logs.
Prefect Cloud (optional) provides enhanced features like dashboard and alerting.
