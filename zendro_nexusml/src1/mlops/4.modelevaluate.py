Let's extend the pipeline by adding Model Evaluation. In this step, we will evaluate the trained models on the test set, assess their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc., and select the best-performing model. We'll also introduce performance monitoring to track the model's performance against defined thresholds.

Steps to Add Model Evaluation:
Testing: Evaluate the trained model on the test set using various metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
Performance Monitoring: Track the modelâ€™s performance and check if it meets predefined thresholds.
Model Selection: Choose the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

Explanation of Model Evaluation:
Testing:

After training, the models are evaluated on the validation dataset (X_val, y_val) using various metrics.
For regression tasks, the model is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
For classification tasks, the metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Performance Monitoring:

We compare the RMSE values (or other metrics depending on the type of model) for all models.
We track whether the performance meets predefined thresholds. For example, you could set an acceptable RMSE threshold for regression tasks, or F1 score for classification tasks.
Model Selection:

The best-performing model is selected based on the lowest RMSE (or the highest F1 score for classification tasks).
The chosen model is returned and could be used for further deployment or production purposes.
Metrics Consideration:
For classification models, if your target variable (y) is categorical, the metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are more appropriate.
For regression models, we use RMSE to evaluate performance.
Running the Pipeline:
Run the Prefect Agent (locally):

bash
Copy
prefect agent start -q default
Execute the Flow:

python
Copy
flow.run()
Monitor Execution:

Check the Prefect UI for task execution.
View the MLflow UI to inspect logged experiments, models, and metrics.
