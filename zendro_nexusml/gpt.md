please help me to build mlops framework that combines aspects for organizing  workflows and pipelines like kedro and managing pipeline production, deployment and monitoring like zenml. the main focus for the framework is on creating reusable, modular, and reproducible pipelines with strong support for versioning and collaboration. On main file run, the output saved artifact, metadata, saved model, check model performance, compare the model, and push to production. Use that production model to push to deploy in deployment and push to monitor in monitoring. also includes , re-taining, pipelines, local db with code. Please clean and remove kedro and zenml

To build a custom MLOps framework that combines aspects of organizing workflows and pipelines like Kedro, while also managing pipeline production, deployment, and monitoring like ZenML, we need to take a modular and reusable approach. The focus should be on ensuring strong support for versioning, collaboration, reproducibility, and model lifecycle management.

Here’s an overview of the framework’s components, followed by the implementation details:

Key Components:
Pipeline Definition: Defining pipelines in a modular, reusable, and composable way.
Versioning: Support for versioning data, code, models, and other artifacts.
Model Management: Storing and managing models, checking model performance, comparing models, and pushing to production.
Deployment: Deployment of models to production environments.
Monitoring: Monitoring the deployed models and retraining when necessary.
Local Database: Local tracking of pipeline runs, model versions, and metadata.
High-Level Architecture:
Pipeline Definition: Using Python functions, classes, or workflows to define modular pipeline steps.
Model Management & Performance Evaluation: Using version-controlled model storage (e.g., MLflow, DVC, or custom solutions) to store, retrieve, and evaluate models.
Deployment & Monitoring: Interfacing with deployment tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) and monitoring services (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
Versioning: Use Git for code versioning and DVC or MLflow for versioning of datasets and models.
Metadata Management: Storing metadata in a lightweight database like SQLite, which can be extended to other databases for more complex use cases.
Example Workflow:
Pipeline Run:

Read data and preprocess.
Train models.
Evaluate models.
Save artifacts and metadata.
Model Evaluation:

Check model performance (metrics).
Compare models.
If model passes criteria, push to production.
Deployment:

Push the model to deployment environments (e.g., through Docker containers, Kubernetes, or cloud services).
Monitor model performance in production (using monitoring tools like Prometheus).
Retraining:

Monitor for model drift.
Trigger retraining based on performance or new data.
Step-by-Step Implementation:

Key Features in the Framework:
Pipeline and Artifact Management: Modular pipeline components, artifacts are saved in the file system with metadata stored in a lightweight SQLite database.
Model Management: Model is versioned and evaluated before saving. Metadata such as model accuracy is stored.
Deployment and Monitoring: Deployment can be done using custom deployment scripts (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) with basic monitoring in place.
Database Integration: A simple local SQLite database stores metadata on pipeline runs, model versions, and artifacts, with capabilities to extend.
Versioning: Ensures code, model, and data versioning, promoting reproducibility.
Next Steps:
Expand Deployment & Monitoring: Integrate with actual deployment and monitoring tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
Automate Retraining: Implement automated retraining triggers based on performance metrics or new data.
Model Comparison & Performance Metrics: Include more evaluation metrics for comparing models.
CI/CD Pipeline: Integrate with CI/CD tools for continuous model deployment and monitoring.
This should provide a robust starting point for your MLOps framework, enabling reusable, modular, and reproducible pipelines with full model lifecycle management.
