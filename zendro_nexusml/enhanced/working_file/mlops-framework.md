# MLOps Framework Architecture

## 1. Overview

This MLOps framework provides a standardized approach to operationalizing machine learning models, from development to deployment and monitoring. It addresses the full lifecycle of ML models with a focus on automation, reproducibility, and governance.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1. Data Pipeline

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated collection from various sources
- **Data Validation**: Schema and quality checks
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardized ETL operations
- **Feature Store**: Centralized repository for feature management
- **Data Versioning**: Track changes and ensure reproducibility

### 2.2. Model Development

- **Experiment Tracking**: Log hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts
- **Version Control**: Git integration for code and configurations
- **Reproducible Environments**: Container-based development
- **Distributed Training**: Scale training across compute resources
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automated tuning

### 2.3. Model Registry

- **Model Versioning**: Systematic versioning of trained models
- **Model Metadata**: Store performance metrics and training context
- **Approval Workflow**: Formalized review and promotion process
- **Model Lineage**: Track data and code dependencies

### 2.4. CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and acceptance testing
- **Model Validation**: Performance and quality benchmarks
- **Deployment Automation**: Push-button or automated deployments
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new models
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Rapid reversion to previous versions

### 2.5. Serving Infrastructure

- **Model Serving**: REST API and batch inference options
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling based on demand
- **Caching**: Optimize inference for common requests
- **Request Logging**: Track all inference requests

### 2.6. Monitoring and Observability

- **Performance Monitoring**: Track latency, throughput, etc.
- **Data Drift Detection**: Monitor changes in input distributions
- **Model Drift Detection**: Track changes in model performance
- **Alerting System**: Notification for anomalies or degradation
- **Dashboarding**: Visualization of key metrics

### 2.7. Governance and Compliance

- **Model Documentation**: Detailed documentation generation
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all system actions
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to resources
- **Compliance Checks**: Automated validation against policies

## 3. Technology Stack

A modular approach allows components to be implemented with different technologies:

- **Data Management**: Apache Airflow, Kafka, Delta Lake
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases
- **Model Registry**: MLflow Model Registry, DVC
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Serving**: TensorFlow Serving, NVIDIA Triton, BentoML
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises
