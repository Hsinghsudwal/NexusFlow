Creating a complete end-to-end MLOps pipeline for customer churn prediction with Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Docker, CI/CD, and monitoring involves several steps. I'll outline the architecture and code snippets for each component to help guide you in building the full pipeline.

Here’s an overview of the steps we’ll follow:

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Model Training
Model Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline for Automation
Monitoring and Retraining
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Assume you have a dataset customer_data.csv with customer attributes and churn labels. You can use pandas and sklearn for preprocessing.

Example Python code for data preprocessing (preprocess.py):
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load and preprocess the dataset
def preprocess_data(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.dropna(inplace=True)

    # Assuming 'churn' is the target column
    X = df.drop(columns=['churn'])
    y = df['churn']

    # Train-Test Split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Feature Scaling
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data('customer_data.csv')

# Train a model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")

# Save model
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
2. Model Training in Kubeflow
Kubeflow allows you to define workflows for ML model training. Here’s a simplified structure of a Kubeflow pipeline.

Pipeline Definition (pipeline.py):

You can create a pipeline in Kubeflow that includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

import kfp
from kfp import dsl

@dsl.pipeline(
    name="Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline",
    description="Pipeline to train a customer churn model"
)
def churn_prediction_pipeline():
    # Define the preprocessing step
    preprocess_op = dsl.ContainerOp(
        name="Data Preprocessing",
        image="python:3.8-slim",  # Specify a Docker image with necessary libraries
        command=["python", "preprocess.py"],
        file_outputs={
            "X_train": "/tmp/X_train.csv",
            "X_test": "/tmp/X_test.csv",
            "y_train": "/tmp/y_train.csv",
            "y_test": "/tmp/y_test.csv"
        }
    )

    # Define the model training step
    train_op = dsl.ContainerOp(
        name="Model Training",
        image="python:3.8-slim",
        command=["python", "train_model.py"],
        arguments=["--X_train", preprocess_op.output["X_train"],
                   "--y_train", preprocess_op.output["y_train"]],
        file_outputs={"model": "/tmp/model.pkl"}
    )
   
    # Define evaluation step
    eval_op = dsl.ContainerOp(
        name="Model Evaluation",
        image="python:3.8-slim",
        command=["python", "evaluate_model.py"],
        arguments=["--model", train_op.output["model"],
                   "--X_test", preprocess_op.output["X_test"],
                   "--y_test", preprocess_op.output["y_test"]]
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kfp.compiler.Compiler().compile(churn_prediction_pipeline, "churn_pipeline.yaml")
Kubeflow Deployment: To run this pipeline in Kubeflow, use the following steps:
Install Kubeflow on your Kubernetes cluster.
Submit the pipeline via the Kubeflow dashboard or using the Kubeflow Python SDK.
kubectl apply -f churn_pipeline.yaml
3. Model Deployment
After training, you can deploy the model using Kubernetes for scaling and high availability.

Dockerfile for Model Deployment (Dockerfile):
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the model
COPY model.pkl /app/

# Copy the inference script
COPY inference.py /app/

# Expose API port
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the Flask API
CMD ["python", "inference.py"]
Flask Inference API (inference.py):
This code runs a simple REST API using Flask to make predictions with the trained model.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Assuming the data is in the correct format
    features = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
You can now build and run this container locally or deploy it to Kubernetes:

docker build -t churn-model-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 churn-model-api
4. CI/CD Pipeline
You can use GitLab, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions to set up CI/CD.

Example GitHub Actions Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml):
name: ML Ops CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
   
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
   
    - name: Test Python Code
      run: |
        pytest
   
    - name: Build Docker Image
      run: |
        docker build -t churn-model-api .
   
    - name: Push Docker Image to DockerHub
      run: |
        docker push churn-model-api

    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
5. Monitoring and Retraining
You can set up monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubeflow Pipelines to track model performance and automate retraining when the performance degrades.

Prometheus Deployment:
Set up Prometheus to monitor your Kubernetes cluster and deploy it to monitor resource usage and model performance.

kubectl apply -f prometheus-deployment.yaml
Retraining Trigger:
You can trigger the retraining process using Kubeflow Pipelines or a Kubernetes CronJob based on model performance or new data.

6. Localstack and Local DBs
Use LocalStack for simulating AWS services locally and a local database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store logs, metrics, or processed data.

Example of using LocalStack (docker-compose.yml):
version: "3.7"
services:
  localstack:
    image: localstack/localstack
    ports:
      - "4566:4566"  # LocalStack API port
    environment:
      - SERVICES=s3,ec2,sns,sqs  # List the services you want to simulate
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
Docker Compose for Local Database (docker-compose.yml):
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: churn_db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:
    driver: bridge
This setup gives you an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for customer churn prediction with Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Docker, CI/CD, and monitoring. You can refine and scale this depending on the complexity of your project.
